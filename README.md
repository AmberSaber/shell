This is the Hawaii desktop environment shell.

It contains a Qt platform theme plugin, shells for different form
factors such as desktop, netbook and tablet and QML plugins.

Only the desktop shell is implemented at the moment though.

Please read the [list of dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md) and how to
