        Only one client can bind this interface at a time.

        Notification surfaces are special surfaces that the user should
        always be able to see. The compositor is in charge of displaying
        them to be visible without disturbing the user workflow.

        This interface must be bound by all notification daemons, ensuring
        that only one can run at a time.

        This request is for daemons which use a list of surfaces.
        Other mechanisms can be used and are not necessarily part of the
